/**
 * Represents the various states of the message transport process within the connector system.
 *
 * <p>Each enumerated value corresponds to a specific phase or outcome of a message's journey
 * through the transport lifecycle. These statuses enable tracking and auditing of messages as they
 * are processed within the system.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>DELIVERED</strong>: Indicates that the message has successfully been delivered
 * to the recipient (e.g., backend or gateway).</li>
 * <li><strong>FAILED</strong>: Indicates that the message could not be delivered due to
 * an error or system failure.</li>
 * <li><strong>SUBMITTED</strong>: Indicates that the message has been submitted to the gateway
 * system for further processing.</li>
 * <li><strong>DOWNLOADED</strong>: Indicates that the recipient or backend system has retrieved
 * or pulled the message.</li>
 * <li><strong>READY_FOR_DOWNLOAD</strong>: Indicates that the message is available for the
 * recipient or backend system to download.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Each status is associated with a predefined priority, represented as an integer value.
 * This priority can be used to determine the relative importance or order of processing
 * between different statuses.
