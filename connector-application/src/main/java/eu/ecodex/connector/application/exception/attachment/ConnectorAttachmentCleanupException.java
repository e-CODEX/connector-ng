/**
 * Exception thrown when the content of some attachments of a message could not be deleted during an

 * the file storage. The attachments whose content was deleted are still marked as deleted; the
 * others stay active, so that a later run can retry them. It reports the message and the number of
 * attachments that failed, so that callers can log it or decide whether to retry.
