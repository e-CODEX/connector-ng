/**
 * Represents a link partner within the connector system, encapsulating the configuration,

 *
 * <p>This record is designed to define the essential properties and configuration for a link
 * partner in the system. It serves to manage the partner details, receiveMode of operation, and
 * associated metadata required for integration and communication purposes.
 *
 * @param name            The name of the link partner, represented by the
 *                        {@link ConnectorLinkPartnerName} record.
 * @param description     A textual description of the link partner, providing additional context or
 *                        details.
 * @param enabled         A flag indicating whether the link partner is currently enabled or
 *                        active.
 * @param receiverMode    The interaction receiveMode of the link, defined by
 *                        {@link ConnectorLinkMode}, specifying how communication or data transfer
 *                        is managed.
 * @param senderMode      The interaction receiveMode of the link, defined by
 *                        {@link ConnectorLinkMode}, specifying how communication or data transfer
 *                        is managed.
 * @param type            The type of the connector link, categorized by {@link ConnectorLinkType},
 *                        distinguishing backend and gateway link types. of the link.
 * @param source          The origin source of the link configuration, defined by
