/**
 * Represents the main structure of a connector message within the system.
 *
 * <p>This record encapsulates the complete state of a message flowing within the system, which
 * includes its identifiers, associated metadata, direction, timestamps, and businessContent. It is
 * used for tracking, auditing, processing, and transforming messages as they transition between the
 * backend and the gateway.
 *
 * @param businessDomainIdentifier            The uuid for the business domain where the message is
 *                                            being used.
 * @param identifier                          A mandatory unique uuid for the message within the
 *                                            system scope.
 * @param backendMessageIdentifier            A mandatory unique uuid for the message from the
 *                                            backend perspective.
 * @param referenceToBackendMessageIdentifier An optional reference to a related backend message
 *                                            uuid.
 * @param backendName                         The name of the backend system. Maybe null.
 * @param gatewayName                         The name of the gateway associated with this message.
 *                                            Maybe null.
 * @param as4Properties                       The AS4-specific metadata and configuration associated
 *                                            with the message.
 * @param direction                           The direction of message flow between the backend
 *                                            system and the gateway.
 * @param createdAt                           The timestamp indicating when the message was first
 *                                            created. Maybe null.
 * @param updatedAt                           The timestamp indicating the most recent update to the
 *                                            message. Maybe null.
 * @param deletedAt                           The timestamp indicating when the message was
 *                                            logically deleted. Maybe null.
 * @param rejectedAt                          The timestamp indicating when the message was rejected
 *                                            during processing. Maybe null.
 * @param confirmedAt                         The timestamp indicating when the backend or gateway
 *                                            confirmed the message. Maybe null.
 * @param deliveredToLinkPartnerAt            The timestamp indicating when the message was
 *                                            delivered to the link partner.
 * @param businessContent                     The core businessContent of the message, encapsulated
 *                                            as XML data and potentially a printable
 *                                            businessDocument. This field determines if the message
 *                                            is considered a business message.
 * @param attachments                         A list of attachment files associated with the
 *                                            message. Maybe null.
 * @param errors                              A list of errors, if any, encountered during message
 *                                            processing. Maybe null.
 * @param evidences                           A list of evidences associated with the message,
 *                                            aiding in auditing and validation. Maybe null.
 * @param transportedEvidences                A subset of evidences that were transported alongside
 *                                            the message, potentially during AS4 transmission.
 *                                            Maybe null.
